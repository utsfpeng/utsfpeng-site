## Summer Studio Portfolio
### Ideas for Summer Studio Portfolio - Final Prototype (for now)

* Researching and Analysing to find a potential vulnerability that has yet to be discovered.
* Create a prototype in software that would demonstrate visually about the security vulnerabilities available in IoT devices or interconnected devices.
* Find security vulnerabilities for a prototype we create.
* Create a software solution that finds certain vulnerabilities or exploits certain security issues/concerns that need to be addressed.

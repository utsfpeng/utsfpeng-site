## Summer Studio Portfolio
### Introduction

{{< figure src="/img/2019-02-introme.jpg" height="327" width="264">}}

I'm Frank Peng, a 5th year Software Engineering Student currently pursuing a Bachelor of Engineering, Majoring in ICT Engineering and Sub-majoring in Software with a Diploma in Professional Engineering Practice (C09067-BEngDipProfEngPrac). I am currently an aspiring Cyber Security Consultant and Software Engineer. I hope that my future work contributes to a positive social impact in the field of software and cyber security as we move towards a growing age of technology.

My main motivation for taking the UTS MIDAS Summer Studio 2019 - Cyber Security: An Offensive Mindset was to explore the possibilities of Cyber Security as a potential future career path for myself when I pursue job opportunities for my senior engineering internship. In addition, I thought that it would be a good introduction to a relevant topic of what I would pursue in my engineering capstone project. I have always had a strong interest in learning Cyber Security but I found that the barriers to entry into actually learning about such a niche field was difficult. Over the past few years, Cyber Security has become more prevalent and I wanted to be a part of such a new and interesting industry, with thoughts about possible future job prospects in mind.

My main objectives that I wanted to achieve by the end of the studio was to be able to develop foundational skills in Cyber Security which would allow me to have the knowledge and skills to pursue further learning afterwards and the potential possibility of gaining a senior internship position in the same or similar field. In addition, I wanted to gain a greater understanding of the potential cyber threats involved and how I might incorporate countermeasures in my software development lifecycle.

### Learning Contract

In the studio subject, I intend to achieve a fundamental cyber security skillset to do web penetration testing, malware/ransomware analysis, cryptography (analysis of encryption/decryption methods), DDos/Dos (Distributed Denial of Service/Denial of Service) attacks and concepts of Active Directory and Remote Desktop Connection that can be exploited.

Later on, I realised I was spreading too thin for time, so I decided to focus on Web Penetration Testing. The reason I decided to narrow my focus down on Web Penetration Testing was due to the fact that it was the skill that would be applicable to a large range of organisations and a good starting point to build upon.

Some of the learning goals that I had set out include:

1. SQL (Structured Query Language) Injection
2. XSS (Cross Site Scripting) Injection
3. CSRF (Cross Site Request Forgery)
4. Using/Creating Exploits
5. Phishing Emails/Links

Some of the tasks that I planned to complete:

1. Bypassing a login screen using SQL Injection.
2. Use a Stored, Reflected or DOM-based XSS Injection on a website.
3. CSRF attack for an administrative action (Changing Password/Email/Contact Details or Transferring Funds/Data)
4. Using/creating exploits on certain systems (Linux or Windows)
5. Learn how to create an effective phishing email or link.

In regards to what I ended up completing, I did learn about SQL Injection, XSS Injection, CSRF, Exploits and Phishing Emails/Links. However, in terms of execution and what I could do in the available subject timeframe I was able to do perform SQL Injection on the login screen, use XSS Injection on a website and use exploits. However, I will carry over my remaining learning goals and tasks as I continue to pursue further learning in the future.

In terms of group projects and teamwork, I was set on contributing equally within the team and if there was a special circumstance that a team member had something urgent or serious going on, I would put in the extra work to get things done.

Consequently, I was fortunate that the studio members were all very reliable and contributed equally to all group-based projects that I participated in. It was well managed and tasks were done on time.

In the process, I have developed a basic skills in Web Penetration Testing and knowledge about common web vulnerabilities that I could exploit to test the security of a website or web app.

Since Cyber Security was more of a skillset and not exactly a product, I was not able to produce a prototype, per se, but I was able to acquire the necessary skills for my learning goal about Web Penetration Testing and Web App Security.

### SLO 1 - Engage with stakeholders to identify a problem

During my time in the Cyber Security Studio, I was fortunate enough to meet various cyber security experts and industry stakeholders invited by our Studio facilitators.

Some of these cyber security experts include:

* Robert Mitchell (Gitlab)
* Viren Khatri, Simon Baeg, Nathan Jones (Deloitte)
* Ruben Thijssen (Symantec)

Robert presented about the evolution of the Cyber Security space and his personal journey through the different eras of the Internet and growth of cyber security threats. His wealth of experience yet humble nature really surprised me and I got to speak to him about the development of the industry and his advice on how I should enter the industry. He presented about the Internet Threats and the various generations of evolution it has undergone.

{{< figure src="/img/portfolio/SLO1-Robert1.PNG">}}

His recounts on witnessing Generation 1 Viruses like Melissa and ILOVEYOU virus to Generation 4 APTs (Advanced Persistent Threats) and Ransomware really gave a very clear overview of how much things have changed with the technology evolution. Furthermore, the lessons he taught us about the mindset and previous lessons from the past being applicable to current and future systems was very eye-opening. It really reinforced the CIA (Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability) Triad that I did not understand from my previous subjects that I learnt at university and it all clicked. It was also very surprising to find out that Human Error was the biggest cause of Cyber Security problems. I always thought that it would be something about the technical aspects that was causing most Cyber Security problems.

Deloitte speakers (Viren, Simon and Nathan) from the Cyber Security Team/ Cyber Intelligence Centre had a more practical-approach presentation in which they gave us a vulnerable machine to hack. It was a very educational lesson that exposed me to a lot of new tools and concepts to go about breaking into a potentially vulnerable system. Their main message about how human error and misconfigurations can cause Cyber Security vulnerabilities to be exposed to individuals with malicious intent who could take advantage and exploit them was very shocking. It made me realise how important it is to monitor and check logs of systems, but also the ease of people breaking into systems that forget to update. They also introduced me to the Metasploit Framework which can be used to find existing exploits for different services and applications. It was really important to note that most of the time it was not necessary to reinvent the wheel, but to use what you have got to break into something. It became a very knowledgeable lesson.

Ruben taught us about Reverse Engineering and Binary Exploitation. It was also a very hands-on presentation and he even prepared a website for us to get access to the resources he created beforehand. It was a whole new world that I did not know before the lesson. It was so surprising to know that we could use the assembly language to look at possible vulnerabilities. We made use of the tool called Binary Ninja to open binary files and explore the different memory/register addresses and locations. It was a lot greater in difficulty than I initially expected due to the lack of ability to infer the operation of certain functions.

Speaking with such a broad variety of external stakeholders has allowed to identify system vulnerabilities in Web Applications such as Heartbleed and the irreversible consequences such as a massive data breach which may cause complex problems including litigations, penalties/fines, loss of brand reputation and customer trust.

### SLO 2 - Apply Design Thinking to respond to a defined or newly identified problems

When attempting to tackle Cyber Security challenges, whether it be Hack The Box Active Machines, OWASP Juice Shop Website or TryHackMe Mr Robot Vulnerable Machine, it is imperative that we think both logically but also outside of the box when the occasion arises. However, as a complete beginner it was hard to know when to stop digging into an endless rabbit hole but move onto a different possible idea. Personally, my innate nature does not like to give up easily, so once I pick up an idea on how to go about solving a specific Cyber Security problem, I would continuously work on it. However, progressing through the Cyber Security studio has challenged my way of thinking and really pushed me out of my comfort zone.

{{< figure src="/img/portfolio/SLO2-JuiceShop.PNG" caption="Caption: Using the search bar as a possible avenue for XSS Injection">}}

An active machine on Hack The Box has no write-ups or walkthroughs, so it is purely based on discovery and finding creative ways to solve the problem at hand. Discovery could include things like enumeration (network, file...etc.), Directory Traversal or experimenting how to use certain tools by trial and error. However, when it comes to problems such as Privilege escalation, Where to launch a reverse shell or how to reach certain directories or acquire certain permissions, it requires a lot of creative thinking on the possible locations that can be used or the different methods of going about it.

During my earlier stages of learning Cyber Security on Natas-wargames by Over The Wire, the challenges really pushed you to be very curious and random about your user input. They would actively encourage you to put special characters to see if you can potentially "break" the system. This involved me designing a method of cycling through all the special characters and observing the results. Afterwards, I would research different combinations that might produce unexpected results such as a Tilda or a dot as the user input. It could be something as simple as appending various text after special characters to bypass the sanitisation and validation algorithms, so that I can successfully disrupt the program to "break" and produce unexpected output.

{{< figure src="/img/natas/natas9-3.PNG">}}

In another scenario, I chose a company website which had a Responsible Disclosure program that allows security researchers and individuals to check for security vulnerabilities under certain guidelines and limitations that would protect you legally from trying to attempt to discover a vulnerability. For example, recently I tried to hack a certain business company's website and after performing the basic steps of discovery, I tried to look at "breaking" the website with invalid session tokens, invalid cookies, changing the format of cookies to something else, changing the HTTP requests to see if they garner any unexpected favourable responses. I tried finding faults in possibly their forget my password functionality or their sign-in page. After trying different things out to no avail, I tried to sabotage their payment details page/ payment gateway to look for any data leaks or possible attack vectors. Exploring all avenues of where possible attacks can be launched demonstrates the problem solving and design thinking processes involved to exploit well-made business websites.

### SLO 3 - Apply  technical skills to develop, model and/or evaluate design

As part of Cyber Security Studio, every single time that we have something that we do not know, we would need to research about it. This could be research on a tool, research on possible security vulnerabilities and exploits, system configurations, certain types of output or files among many other things.

{{< figure src="/img/portfolio/SLO3-OWASP.PNG" caption="Caption: Researching XSS Injection on OWASP Top 10 for common vulnerabilities and exploits">}}

Since Cyber Security is never straight forward and every single machine and challenge is something new and fresh, a lot of things will need to be researched. The structure of the system and environment could be similar, but there are a lot of different configurations, services and settings that we do not usually remember because it might only be used once only when we need to due to a specific setup. Hence, there is always a need to research possible security vulnerabilities that might be applicable to a certain setup whether that be a Linux or Windows environment, the version that they are using, the updates/patches that they have installed, configurations and settings adjustments among many others.

{{< figure src="/img/portfolio/SLO3-CVE.PNG" caption="Caption: Researching SSH CVEs to exploit a particular version of OpenSSH">}}

For example, when I was attempting to gain access to a system using PHP as their main language, I had to research how to get a reverse shell running on the target machine. Hence, I had to look up commands to use on the command line.

### SLO 4 - Demonstrate effective collaboration and communication skills

Within the Cyber Security Studio, we were required to research and present findings in class to share our knowledge on different Cyber Security related topics.

A Bug Bounty Presentation was presented in class to explain how certain organisations encourage security researchers to find security vulnerabilities before hackers find them and use it for malicious purposes.

In addition, as part of the Expo, a presentation was made to state our highlights, lowlights and insights with a live demo of the type of work that we were doing for the past 4 weeks.

Furthermore, when working on group projects/presentations, we would collaborate over Microsoft Teams to coordinate the different sections of work and also use the planner plugin to allocate tasks to each individual team member.

Moreover, within the classroom we did Free-4-All sessions, they were basically ways of getting to know other people that we do not normally talk to and discuss about milestones, challenges and roadblocks encountered throughout the week. The studio facilitators intentionally made us go out of our comfort zone and pair us up with people we have not met or hardly talk to. As a result, they built this community spirit studio which I am very grateful for.

### SLO 5 - Conduct Critical Self and Peer Review and Performance Evaluation

Throughout the Cyber Security Studio, I did self-reflections on both the week/sprint as a whole and also documented my individual learning journey in my blog to reflect after the activity and see how much I retain in my memory and also what things I should note down so I don't forget. In addition, I have also been receiving weekly feedback from my studio facilitators on each of my weekly submissions to note down areas that I need to improve on and areas that I am doing well in. However, something that has caught me by surprise was the fact that other classmates have used my blog as a reference for their work, such as using one of my first posts to setup a static site generator called GoHugo (Hugo).

{{< figure src="/img/portfolio/SLO5-Andy.PNG" >}}

After our face-to-face lessons, the studio facilitators (special mentions to Darsh, Larry and Luke) stay back to have 1 on 1 conversations with students to check up on their progress and ask any lingering questions or resolve any uncertainties. It has been valuable to have this feedback while going through such an intensive 4 week session since sometimes it goes so fast that you forget to breathe. Personally, this clarification goes along way for me since I tend to be a perfectionist and like to dwell over minor details which are ambiguous, so that confirmation really gives me the confidence that I am moving in the right direction.

Additionally, the studio facilitators have taken on the feedback that I have provided within my weekly blog submissions to improve the studio in the next lessons which made me feel that they truly valued the feedback that they were given and worked hard towards providing us with the best education possible. This quick iteration and uptake of feedback is something I consider what made the Cyber Security Studio so successful and an experience that I will cherish forever.

I really appreciate the feedback that I got within the studio since it wasn't generic like a lot of other subject feedback that I get during normal university sessions. It was very tailored and identified specific areas of interest that were good or needed more work on.

Personally, I still believe that I need more experience with active machines on Hack The Box and also getting more familiar with tools such as Burp Suite for networking purposes and Hydra for brute-forcing purposes. In addition, I need to find a more logical way or series of steps for enumeration and starting off a new active box from scratch. This may be aided by a self-designed cheat sheet in order to better remember what to do.


### Conclusion

The Cyber Security Studio has enabled me to meet some of the highest priority objectives and also helped me redefine my other objectives to something achievable with long-term commitment to putting in the effort. I have come out from the other side after finishing the studio with the basic skillset and concepts covered, more than what I expected. I could never imagine that I would be able to go from "Boot 2 Root" for my very first box on Hack The Box within the 4 week timeframe. After finding my passion for Cyber Security in the studio, I have decided on seriously pursuing a Cyber Security related position for my senior internship placement in order to further improve upon my skillset and develop myself professionally.

### Final Reflective Statement

In the duration of my learning journey in UTS MIDAS Summer Studio 2019 - Cyber Security: An Offensive Mindset, I have successfully satisfied all five subject learning outcomes. In regards to SLO 1 - Engage with stakeholders to identify a problem, I have interacted with various industry professionals and spoke about the evolution of security vulnerabilities, received support and advice on how to pursue Cyber Security as a profession, identified how to use and mitigate exploits and how to scan a network for services and ports. As for SLO 2 - Apply Design Thinking to respond to a defined or newly identified problem, I have tried Web Pen-testing a business website with responsible disclosure and used creative methods to explore possible vulnerabilities that may exist. In terms of SLO 3 - Apply technical skills to develop, model and/or evaluate design, I have researched various security vulnerabilities while attempting to complete certain Cyber Security challenges and Hack The Box Machines which have allowed me to correctly evaluate design decisions made by the original creator/developer. In addition, I have also evaluated poor design choices which have exposed security vulnerabilities and possible exploits that could be used against it, in order to achieve the objective of ultimately gaining user and root access. To achieve SLO 4 - Demonstrate effective collaboration and communication skills, I have actively participated in group presentations and discussions like Free 4 All and also helped people set up their static sites and git environment. Concerning SLO 5 - Conduct Critical Self and Peer review and Performance evaluation, I have written self-reflections weekly along with notes of my different learning journeys across different tools and machines so that it is there for future reference when I need it again. Subsequently, I have also identified the need to improve my skills in Burp Suite and Hydra among other tools that come pre-installed as part of Kali Linux OS.

Thank you so much for running the UTS MIDAS Summer Studio 2019 - Cyber Security: An Offensive Mindset!

I really enjoyed it!

## Week 4 Reflection (Sprint 4)

Week 4 has been a very eventful week, full of challenges and accomplishments. It is also the last week of UTS MIDAS Summer Studio 2019 and I have nothing but great things to say about this Cyber Security studio which has helped me to learn about Cyber Security from scratch. It has been nothing short of amazing and I did not expect a summer studio to not only push me so far out of my comfort zone but also teach me more than I can ever imagine.

We started the week off with Reverse Engineering with Ruben Thijssen, a speaker/presenter from Symantec. He presented us with a series of challenges that we had to solve that involved working with assembly instructions and binary files.

More on that over at: http://frankpeng.me/blog/2019-02/reverse-engineering/

Afterwards, we were encouraged to go from "Boot2Root" on a vulnerable machine. An extra level of difficulty was to work on ones which have no write-ups/walkthroughs. Hence, we did an active vulnerable machine on Hack The Box called <REDACTED>. This involved using a variety of network-based tools to discover ports and services being used. In addition, we had to utilise reverse shells for privilege escalation and a lot of trial and error in between. It was my very first experience going from nothing to gaining access/entry into the machine to gaining access to user and then eventually escalating that to root privileges. It was endless hours of trial and error and exploring different files and services that may be exploitable, but also discovering that being too technical, I could be over-thinking what needs to be done.

<REDACTED> was a vulnerable machine which was based relatively more on enumeration and real-life. Hence, it was a great starter box for me to get my first hands-on experience.

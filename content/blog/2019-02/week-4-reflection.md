## Week 4 Reflection (Sprint 4)

Week 4 has been a very eventful week, full of challenges and accomplishments. It is also the last week of UTS MIDAS Summer Studio 2019 and I have nothing but great things to say about this Cyber Security studio which has helped me to learn about Cyber Security from scratch. It has been nothing short of amazing and I did not expect a summer studio to not only push me so far out of my comfort zone but also teach me more than I can ever imagine.

We started the week off with Reverse Engineering with Ruben Thijssen, a speaker/presenter from Symantec. He presented us with a series of challenges that we had to solve that involved working with assembly instructions and binary files.

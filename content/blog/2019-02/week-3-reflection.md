## Week 3 Reflection (Sprint 3)

Week 3 was quite an intensive week at the Cyber Security Summer Studio. We became more focused on improving our practical cyber security skills with real world testing, a variety of vulnerable VMs and taking on different cyber security challenges.

On Monday, we started off the week with a Free For All session and I catched up with David. David had tried API testing on the industry sponsor's website: <REDACTED>. He tried checking robots.txt, bit swapping with a similar username to one that may exist (e.g. rupport instead of support and then flipping the bit). Furthermore, he also tried out brute forcing and also trying out different ways to get into admin. In addition, his testing led him to find out that the version of nginx that the industry sponsor's website was using and found CVE details that reveal things can could be exploited.

After the Free-For-All session, our studio facilitators took on our feedback and worked on improving our studio for the better based on the feedback that they received. As a student of the studio, it is really reassuring to know that the studio facilitators are putting in so much effort into the studio. It's nice to know that our feedback actually matters and gets taken into account.

In regards to what our first task of the week, it was a group presentation on a tool that could be used to break into complex and vulnerable systems. After discussion and finding team members to collaborate with me, I formed a group with Andy Lee, Vishal Uniyal and Ian Szklinski. We dedicated our presentation on Aircrack-ng.  Aircrack-ng is a networking suite commonly used for monitoring and cracking WEP, WPA, WPA2 password-protected wireless networks. It can monitor and collect information on 802.11 WLANs.

In our presentation, we looked at some of the commonly used tools for cracking WEP,WPA,WPA2 within the Aircrack-ng suite. These include: Airodump, Aireplay and Aircrack.

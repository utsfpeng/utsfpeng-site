## Revised Problem Statement

"Web Applications have become an everyday essential, but most lack sufficient cyber security measures."

Web Applications have become a quintessential sales channel for any business and a revenue driver for eCommerce organisations. However, when building a web application for most businesses, security is not at the forefront of the development process, leading to exposed security vulnerabilities to their business' most important assets.

By investigating security vulnerabilities on modern web applications and researching on the resources & material available, I hope to discover the impacts that the OWASP Top 10 Application Security Risks can have on a modern web application, with regards to Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability.

In 2017, eCommerce was responsible for $2.3 trillion dollars in sales and expected to grow to $4.5 trillion in 2021. (Hatch 2018) Hence, it is a very attractive target for Cyber criminals to focus on and try to make a profit from. Hence, it is pivotal that everything needs to be done to protect these web applications from cyber security vulnerabilities and attacks. Hence, I would like to research on the different attack vectors and solutions available for implementation to prevent disruption to these increasingly significant services from Cyber Security threats.


Deliverables:

* Exploring vulnerable web applications - Learning & Documenting my experiences

* Content:
  - Natas (Wargames)
  - Bandits (Wargames)
  - Hack The Box
  - Try Hack Me (Mr Robot)
  - WebGoat
  - Web for pentesters (Pentester Lab)
  - PicoCTF

* Technical Write-ups, Code (Source Code, Scripts...etc.), Screenshots, Barriers, Research Findings.

* Documentation of process/procedure for the different challenges.

### Current Progress (As of 17/02/2019)

* Up to Natas 11 (Natas Journey: Write-up)
* Finished Hack The Box Invite Challenge, but haven't started on any other challenges or boxes.
* Tried Try Hack Me (Mr Robot), but haven't made any solid progress.
* Looking to try WebGoat next or the new industry sponsored web pen-test website.

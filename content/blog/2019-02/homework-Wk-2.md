## Week 2 - Homework
### Problem Statement

A realistic and achievable goal that I set for myself is to gain fundamentals skills in pen-testing, so that I am able to have a solid skill set that I can build upon after the studio to go towards a future career in cyber security.

Developing the basic mindset of being curious about errors and also how to actually go about testing.
E.g.
* Checking Source Code
* Going through Robots.txt
* Checking HTTP GET/POST Requests and their Responses.
* Directory traversing
* Looking for any access control misconfigurations
* XSS injection into all the input fields, especially search bar
* SQL injection into login screen input fields.

Currently, I have zero knowledge of Cyber Security in regards to what tools and techniques to use for pen-testing and I want to improve my general ability to detect web application security vulnerabilities.

I have been recommended PicoCTF, HackTheBox, natas and bandits (Wargames) to start myself on the journey of learning.

Also the resources recommended in this week for web penetration skills development include:
* [Web for Pentester](https://www.pentesterlab.com/exercises/web_for_pentester/)
* [WebGoat](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category%3aOWASP_WebGoat_Project)
* [Natas](http://overthewire.org/wargames/natas/)
* [Shellter Labs](https://shellterlabs.com/en/)
* [Root Me](https://www.root-me.org/?lang=en)

Ref: https://utscyber.studio/learn/Week%202%20-%20Feb%2011/

Possible milestones to my goal:

* Being able to complete all the Natas challenges
* Going through PentesterLab Exercises and the Bootcamp.
* Try the HackTheBox platform and get to root for a few boxes (min 3).

IDEAL:

Ideally I would like to be able to hold my own ground when finding common web app security vulnerabilities and knowing how to check if they exist or not.

REALITY:

In reality, I don't have the knowledge, skill or experience to currently search for common web security vulnerabilities when given the task to do so. I will still need to heavily rely on "Google-ing" my way through most if not all techniques on exposing vulnerabilities.

CONSEQUENCES:

* Without knowing the basics, I have trouble starting off and take longer to find basic security vulnerabilities.
* Lack the knowledge to discover more well-hidden vulnerabilities due to not knowing what to search for.
* Unable to progress far on CTFs.

PROPOSAL:
* Learn how to discover common web vulnerabilities and what different areas to look out for.
* Building a basic foundation of skills in finding web security vulnerabilities and how to expose them with different tools.

### Responsible Disclosure

Responsible Disclosure policy allows security researchers/individuals that discover a vulnerability to be able to safely report an issue to the affected organisation or target.

Responsible Disclosure policy requires a few things to be defined to safely organise vulnerability reporting, these include:
* What is within scope? (Parts/Sections of a site where testing is allowed)
* Types of bugs/vulns(vulnerabilities) are recognised as valid for submission
* Dedicated location to contact/report the issue, such as a security team email.

There are certain best practices in the industry for responsible disclosure such as timely response to vulnerability report/disclosure from a security researcher, reasonable ETA (Estimated time of arrival) for a patch/fix of the security issue, not taking legal action/threats towards security researchers, transparency and prompt reaction to discovered issues and mutual respect.

### Bug Bounty

Bug bounty programs are crowdsourcing bug hunting initiatives that reward individuals reporting discovered bugs/vulnerabilities with financial benefits and recognition.

It is a proactive approach to encouraging responsible disclosure with well-defined scope and guidelines that allow security researchers to safely raise awareness of security vulnerabilities to organisations. This is done through structured write-ups/reports that allow bugs to be identified quickly with sufficient information to reproduce the vulnerability for verification.

#### How ethical hacking and bug bounties are impacting stakeholders?

Ethical hacking and bug bounties are being widely embraced by major organisations from both the public and private sector. These stakeholders in both government and corporate are realising the potential that bug bounties have for their organisations, in terms of finding existing vulnerabilities that have gone unnoticed for months, if not years. Ethical hackers (or white-hat hackers) are now held in a more positive spotlight for helping organisations to identify flaws in their IT services and systems which they should patch up and fix to increase their resistance against cyber security threats and possible data breaches.

Major organisations are now using bug bounties as a way to enhance their existing cyber security efforts and allow them to repair faults and flaws in their services and systems to become more robust and secure than before. Organisations are now more aware than ever before about the possible implications of data breaches, ransomware, state-sponsored attacks and phishing scams since it affects the operations and functions of an organisation to its very core.

Ethical hacking and bug bounties bring accountability and transparency of security issues of organisations to the spotlight. They not only protect the reputation of the organisation but also ensures that everyone is collectively doing what they can together to prevent possible black-hat hackers or state-sponsored hackers since there is an increasingly growing reliance on IT software, systems and services as everyone progresses towards a more inter-connected world. It is now more crucial than ever before that the systems and services that store sensitive information and personal data are resilient against cyber security attacks. Ethical hackers and bug bounty programs helps with raising critical bugs and security vulnerabilities and are met with a more positive reception that embraces and welcomes the idea of having these issues brought to their attention. Since organisations are realising the value that it brings and understand the need to be aware of the security issues that they possess in order to quickly remediate and fix them.

#### How you can implement things you've learnt throughout the week to test web apps under a responsible disclosure program?

I can implement the knowledge and skills that I've learnt throughout this week to testing web apps by participating in reputable platforms like HackerOne and BugCrowd that have bug bounty programs that allow me to safely submit bug reports under a responsible disclosure program that makes a confidential communication between the organisation affected and myself, allowing me to communicate their security issues to them. It also allows them to have sufficient time to fix the issue instead of a full disclosure and going public while it still hasn't been fixed can cause financial and reputational damage. However, this all means understanding and respecting the scope and guidelines that are acceptable by the organisation, so that you are acting within their expectations and not exceeding the boundaries that may cause legal action to be taken against you.

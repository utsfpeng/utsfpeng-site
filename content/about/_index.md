What about me? ("Shannon Noll Reference for those old enough to remember")

I am a 5th year Software Engineering Student at UTS. Currently, I am undertaking the UTS MIDAS Summer Studio 2019, Cyber Security Studio to improve my Cyber Security abilities so that I can increase my exposure to the Cyber Security space in general and acquire some fundamentals skills that I can take with me to my Senior internship and future career pursuits.

In terms of hobbies, besides trying to learn about programming and software development and trying to create VBS viruses (script kiddies), I would spend part of my time on photography. Nothing special though, since I am still learning how to use a DSLR, but exploring the professional photography space in general as a hobby to get away from the busy city lifestyle.

This website is a platform for me to express my reflections for Summer Studio 2019 and also present my portfolio for my end of studio deliverable for now. However, I hope this is a start to something better in the future.

If you would like to get in touch with me, hit me up via [email](mailto:frank.peng@student.uts.edu.au) or [linkedin](https://au.linkedin.com/in/frank-peng).

Thanks for checking out my site!

Cheers,

Frank
